To read a graph with RPM (revolutions per minute) as the y-axis and distance as the x-axis, you would typically follow these steps:

- Identify the x-axis and y-axis labels: In this case, the x-axis represents distance, which is typically measured in meters, and the y-axis represents RPM, which is typically measured in revolutions per minute.
- Look for patterns or trends: Look at the shape of the graph to see if there are any patterns or trends. For example, you might see that the RPM increases as the car accelerates down a straightaway, and then decreases as the car approaches a corner and slows down.
- Look for key points: Look for key points on the graph, such as peaks or valleys, that indicate important moments during the race. For example, you might see a peak in RPM as the car shifts into a higher gear, or a valley in RPM as the car slows down for a corner.
- Consider the context: Consider the context of the graph, such as the track layout, weather conditions, and other factors that might affect the car's performance. This can help you understand why the RPM might be higher or lower in certain areas of the track.
- Compare to other data: Finally, you can compare the RPM graph to other data, such as speed or lap times, to get a more complete picture of the car's performance. By analyzing multiple data points, you can gain a deeper understanding of how the car is performing and identify areas where improvements can be made.
